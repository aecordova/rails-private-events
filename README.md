## Description of the project 

The purpose of this project is to practice Rails Associations knowledge by building an app similar to EventBrite (ata avery basic level) Where a user can organize events and record all the related information about it in the app, Te user can also see all the events organized by other users and Register to them by clicking a button. In his dashboard, the user can see the info of his account, as well as his created and attending events, broken down by past and upcoming

**This Project focuses on the data structures for Users and Events, not on the front end, however we used Bootstrap CDN to improve the look and feel**  

The full projects requirements and information can be found in [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/ruby-on-rails/lessons/associations)
